# Task 01 : Basic REST API with CRUD Operations
## Problem Statement : Create an API with endpoints to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a users resource.
### constraints : 
- 1. Each user should have fields: id (UUID), name, email, and age.
- 2. Use an in-memory data structure (like an hashmap) for storage.
- 3. Ensure proper status codes and error handling (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).
- 4. Include basic input validation (e.g., checking if email is valid).
